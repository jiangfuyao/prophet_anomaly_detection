## Time-series Anomaly Detection with Prophet

Time-series anomaly detection with [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), Facebook's open-source library ([github](https://github.com/facebook/prophet))

## Usage

As shown in the [example notebook](https://github.com/paullo0106/prophet_anomaly_detection/blob/master/example.ipynb), we added [utility functions](https://github.com/paullo0106/prophet_anomaly_detection/blob/master/utils.py) based on Facebook's Prophet time-series forecast library,
to quickly experiment different model setting, time windows, and visualize the results in an intuitive manner.
